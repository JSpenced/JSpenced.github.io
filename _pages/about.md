# About Me

width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I enjoy thinking deeply and using data to solve complex problems that result in actionable insights. I have extensive experience in building models from various domains that include speech, images, and tabular data. My primary language is Python using many of the familiar ML libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, pandas, etc... I also enjoy working in Java and C++.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Melbourne where I developed computational models of music and speech perception. Most recently I have developed a tattoo artist recommendation web application called TatRec that you input an image of a tattoo and get back local artists' (Instagram pages) that tattoo in that style.
