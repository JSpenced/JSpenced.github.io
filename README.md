# JSpenced.github.io

Source for [jspenced.github.io](https://jspenced.github.io), hosted on GitHub Pages. Functions to present work I've done and anything I found interesting related to computing and machine learning.

To build the site locally, do

	git clone https://github.com/JSpenced/JSpenced.github.io.git
	cd JSpenced.github.io
    gem install bundler # to get the dependency manager that jekyll uses
	bundle update # to make sure all ruby gems are up to date
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	
Then navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to view the page.
